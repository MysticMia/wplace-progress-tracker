Program with some utilities for wplace. Downloads chunks from the canvas,
crops them to the right size, and compares it to a template. This yields an
image of the remaining pixels. In combination with `count_pixels.py` and
`pixel_progress_grapher.py`, a graph can be created to track the progress of
pixel placement and the number of pixels left to be placed.
